-PROFILE PICTURE AND ABOUT ME TEXT
    Hello! My name is Joshua, and I have been working in the field of Radiology for the past 18 years, 11 of which in Magnetic Resonance Imaging. I chose to switch careers into technology because I enjoy working on and learning how websites, applications, and video games are all created from the front to backend of developmental stages. I look forward to complete LaunchCode with the proper skills needed to work in a career I am fully passionate about.
